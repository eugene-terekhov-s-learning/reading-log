# Reading Log
Repository to keep up my reading log and create / maintain reading plans and lists

## Record format
The reading log is kept in `HaveRead.txt` file, where each row corresponds to a book or audiobook that I've read / listened to. Each row should be formatted as follows:

```
YYYYMMDD - Book title, автор Author's Name [ppp:rr]fs
```

where:

* `YYYYMMDD` - Date the book was finished on,
* `Book title` - self-explanatory
* `Author's Name` - self-explanatory, first name first. In case when there are several authors, their names are separated with `; `
* `ppp` - number of pages (0 for audiobooks)
* `rr` - rating (1-10)
* `f` - book format (+ for books, @ for audiobooks)
* `s` - special marks, could be many of them (^ - have read that book before, * - really awesome title, # - non-fiction book)
